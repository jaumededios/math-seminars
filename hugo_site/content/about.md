### About this site

When the Covid-19 epidemic started, a lot of universities started hosting their seminars online, which meant we could attend each others' seminars.

This site attempts to gather as many online math seminars from around the world as possible that use zoom/similar and have a publicly available means to access the talk. 

If you know about a seminar you would like to see here message me at `jdedios at math dot ucla dot edu`. Message me as well if you want me to remove/modify your seminar entry.

### About me

I'm Jaume de Dios Pont, a second year grad student at UCLA, doing mostly Harmonic Analysis/Restriction theory. Once I have a personal website I'll make sure to make some shameless self-promotion here so that you can learn a bit more about me.
