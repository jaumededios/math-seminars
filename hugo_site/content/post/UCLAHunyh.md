Recently the conservation of energy in the Euler equations was proved on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, with the velocity field in the Besov space $B^{1/3}_ {3,1}$, using intrinsic harmonic analysis based on the heat kernel. Now, by manually constructing the heat kernel with the techniques from microlocal analysis, we attain off-diagonal decay for all derivatives, and extend the result to a closed subspace of $B^{1/3}_ {3,\infty}$.
