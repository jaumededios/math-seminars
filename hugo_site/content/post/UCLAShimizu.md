Every smooth proper algebraic variety over a p-adic field is expected to have semistable model after passing to a finite extension. This conjecture is open in general, but its analogue for p-adic Galois representations, the p-adic monodromy theorem, is known. In this talk, we will explain a generalization of this theorem to etale local systems on a smooth rigid analytic variety.
