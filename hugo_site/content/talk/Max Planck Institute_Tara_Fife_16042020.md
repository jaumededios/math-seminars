Matroids were introduced by Whitney in 1935 to provide an abstract generalization of the notion of linear independence. Whitney noted that matroids arise naturally from graphs and from matrices. More recently, people have discovered ties to matroid theory and algebraic geometry. In this talk, I will first introduce matroid theory, along with some key examples, and central questions. I will then discuss connections between matroid theory and nonlinear algebra.

One day before each seminar, an announcement with the Zoom link is mailed to the NASO e-mail list. To receive these e-mails, please sign up by writing to Alexander Heaton (see external homepage for link).
