We review Parisi and Wu's stochastic quantisation procedure and apply
it to the non-linear sigma model as well as the Yang-Mills model. We then
review a number of recent results on the resulting equations. In
particular, this sheds some new light on an old controversy regarding the
interpretation of path integrals.
