In this talk, based on joint work with Corentin Caillaud and Thomas Pock, I will discuss the merits of some finite differences or finite elements discretizations of the total variation functional. I will mention error bounds for the recovery of sharp discontinuities, inpainting straight lines in 2D, and trying to improve on some recent approaches proposed in the literature.
