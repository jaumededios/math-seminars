One main theme of the algebraic K-stability theory of Fano varieties is to use it to construct moduli spaces of K-(semi,polystable) Fano varieties. Several main ingredients have been established, based on the recent development of our understanding of K-stability theory and other inputs. In this talk, we will discuss the current status of the construction.
