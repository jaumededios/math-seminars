We will first give an introduction to the formalism of (p,q)-forms and currents on non-archimedean spaces, as defined by Chambert-Loir--Ducros and Gubler--Kannemann. We explain how a notion of Greens current can be used to reinterpret intersection numbers on p-adic formal schemes in their generic fiber; at least in some cases. We finally apply these considerations to an intersection problem of quadratic CM-cycles on Lubin-Tate space. Here, all expressions in question can be evaluated neatly at infinite level and we recover an intersection number formula from Qirui Li.
