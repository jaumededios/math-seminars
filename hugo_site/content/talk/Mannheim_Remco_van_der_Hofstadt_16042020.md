Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the entire world has been forced to slow down. The scientific community has been no exception with cancellations of conferences, seminars and research visits. We are all forced to build up new communication channels, the One World Probability Seminar is an attempt to keep our community together. Here is an artistic description of the situation (due to Itai Benjamini). The short term goal is to provide access to a seminar for as many researchers as possible. For the indefinite future, the seminar is intended to foster ideas among our truly global research community and to help reduce our impact on climate change.
