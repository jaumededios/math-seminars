It is known, by work of Bochi, Mañé, Viana and others
that Lyapunov exponents are highly sensitive to perturbations of a
dynamical system. On the other hand, work of Ledrappier, Young
and my work with Froyland and Gonz´alez-Tokman has shown that
in some situations, under “noise-like” perturbations, Lyapunov exponents vary continuously.
We are particularly interested in cocycles of Perron-Frobenius
operators, as the Lyapunov exponents (and the corresponding Oseledets spaces) are related to rates of mixing (and the spaces can
identify obstructions to mixing). We discuss a test case of a random composition of Blaschke products, and their Perron-Frobenius
operators acting on a Hardy space of analytic functions. These operators are known to be compact. We identify the full Lyapunov
spectrum of these systems, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the spectrum. [Joint work with Cecilia
Gonz´alez-Tokman.]
