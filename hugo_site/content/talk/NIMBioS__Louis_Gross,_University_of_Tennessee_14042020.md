Policies for the COVID-19 pandemic response have relied upon models of various types to project future trends and assess the potential impacts of alternative amelioration strategies. I invite you to join us for basic overviews of the process of modeling, the “art” of model construction, and the array of different kinds of approaches (mathematical, computational, and graphical) that are applied in the life sciences. The presentation is designed for a general audience without modeling background.
