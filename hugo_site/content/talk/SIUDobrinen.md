Just how far can Ramsey's Theorem on the natural numbers be pushed when, instead of coloring all k-sized subsets of the natural numbers, one is coloring copies of a finite structure inside some infinite structure? There is a host of results extending the finite Ramsey theorem to classes of finite structures, but much less so for the infinite Ramsey Theorem. I will give some overview of results known so far and some current work aimed towards showing that a wider class of known finite Ramsey classes also have infinite Ramsey theorems. It should be noted that the infinite Ramsey theorems on infinite structures rarely yield one color; usually the best possible is to obtain finite bounds called "big Ramsey degrees."
