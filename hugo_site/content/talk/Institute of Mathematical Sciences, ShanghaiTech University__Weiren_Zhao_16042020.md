In this talk, I am going to talk about the nonlinear inviscid damping for a class of monotone shear flows in the finite channel for initial perturbation in Gevrey class with compact support. The main idea of the proof is to use the wave operator of a slightly modified Rayleigh operator in a well chosen coordinate system. This is a joint work with Nader Masmoudi.
