The Kudla-Rapoport conjecture predicts a precise identity between the arithmetic intersection number of special cycles on unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces and the derivative of local representation densities of hermitian forms. It is a key local ingredient to establish the arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula and the arithmetic Rallis inner product formula, relating the height of special cycles on Shimura varieties to the derivative of Siegel Eisenstein series and L-functions. We will motivate this conjecture, explain a proof and discuss global applications.

This is joint work with Wei Zhang.
