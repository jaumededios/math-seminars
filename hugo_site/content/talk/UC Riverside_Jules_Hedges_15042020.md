I will talk about open games, and the closely related concepts of lenses/optics and open learners. My goal is to report on the successes and failures of an ongoing effort to try to realise the often-claimed benefits of categories and compositionality in actual practice. I will introduce what little theory is needed along the way. Here are some things I plan to talk about:

* Lenses as an abstraction of the chain rule
* Comb diagrams
* Surprising applications of open games: Bayesian inference, value function iteration
* The state of tool support
* Open games in their natural habitat: microeconomics
* Sociological aspects of working with economics
