 r algebraic variety over a p-adic field is expected to have semistable mod
 el after passing to a finite extension. This conjecture is open in general
 \, but its analogue for p-adic Galois representations\, the p-adic monodro

 this theorem to etale local systems on a smooth rigid analytic variety.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Host: UCLA \nSpeaker: Matthew Foreman (UC Irvine) \nURL: https
 ://secure.math.ucla.edu/seminars/display.php?&id=834026 \n\n---\nIn his cl
 assical 1932 paper\, von Neumann asked 3 questions: Can you classify the s
 tatistical behavior of differentiable systems? Are there systems where tim
 e-forward is not isomorphic to time-backward? Is every abstract statistica
 l system isomorphic to a differentiable system? These questions can be add
 ressed with some surprising consequences by embedding them in Polish Space
 s. Indeed the tools answer other questions from the 60's and 70's such as 
 the existence of diffeomorphisms with arbitrary Choquet simplexes of invar
 iant measures. Moreover there are surprising analogues to Hilbert's 10th p
 roblem.\n\nIn a different category\, building on work of Poincare\, Smale 
 proposed classifying the qualitative behavior of differentiable systems on
  compact manifolds. His 1967 paper explicitly argued that the equivalence 
 relation of "conjugacy up to homeomorphism" captures this notion and he pr
 oposes classifying it. Call this notion topological equivalence. Very rece
 nt joint results with A. Gorodetski show:\n\n- The equivalence relation $E
  _ 0$ is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of 
 any smooth 2-manifold.\n\n- The equivalent relation of Graph Isomorphism i
 s Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smo
 oth manifold of dimension 5 or above.\n\nAs corollaries\, none of the clas
 sical numerical invariants such as entropy\, rates of growth of periodic p
 oints and so forth\, can classify diffeomorphisms of 2-manifolds\, and the
 re is no Borel classification at all of diffeomorphisms of 5-manifolds.\n\
 nIn the same 1967 paper Smale asks (in different language) whether there i
 s a generic class that can be classified. This is still an open problem.\n

 \nURL: https://mathematics.stanford.edu/events/combinatorics/pure-pairs \n
 \n---\nA "pure pair" in a graph $G$ is a pair $(X\,Y)$ of disjoint subsets
  of $V(G)$ such that either every vertex in $X$ is adjacent to every verte
 x in $Y$\, or there are no edges from $X$ to $Y$. Let $f(G)$ be the bigges
 t $k$ such that $G$ has a pure pair $(X\,Y)$ with $|X|\,|Y|$ at least $k$.
  In general\, $f(G)$ is logarithmic in $|G|$\, and for any fixed graph $H$
 \, if $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph then $f(G)$ is polyn
 omial in $|G|$. (This is a result of Erdos\, Hajnal and Pach.) But when is
  $f(G)$ linear in $|G|$?\n\nA couple of years ago\, we proved a nice thing
 \, a conjecture of Liebenau and Pilipczuk: for any finite set $C$ of graph
 s\, $f(G)$ is linear in $G|$ for all graphs with no induced subgraph in $C
 $\, if and only $C$ contains a forest and the complement of a forest. This
  result has grown a number of extensions and variations since. (What about
  bipartite graphs? What about ordered graphs? What about nearly-linear? Wh
 at if the two sets have different sizes?).\n\n\nJoint work with Maria Chud

  and a cross ratio on said boundary. There is a series of results that tel
 l us that\, for sufficiently nice CAT(-1) spaces\, the boundary together w
 ith the cross ratio uniquely determines the interior space. The proof of t
 hese results can be understood in terms of the construction of a circumcen
 ter extension map. It turns out that this relationship between boundary an
 d interior space generalizes nicely to a large class of CAT(0) spaces. In 
 this talk\, we will survey some known results\, explain the construction o
 f the circumcenter extension and show that the boundary roughly determines

 URL: https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference.html \n\n---\nIn 1984\, 
 Mahler asked how well typical points on Cantor’s set can be approximated
  by\nrational numbers. His question fits within a program\, set out by him
 self in the 1930s\, attempting to\ndetermine conditions under which subset
 s of $\\mathbb R^d$\ninherit the Diophantine properties of the ambient\nsp
 ace. Since the approximability of typical points in Euclidean space by rat
 ional points is governed\nby Khinchine’s classical theorem\, the ultimat
 e form of Mahler’s question asks whether an analogous\nzero-one law hold
 s for fractal measures. Significant progress has been achieved in recent y
 ears\,\nalbeit\, almost all known results have been of “convergence type
 ”.\nIn this talk\, we will discuss the first instances where a complete 
 analogue of Khinchine’s theorem\nfor fractal measures is obtained. Our r
 esults hold for fractals generated by rational similarities of $\\mathbb R
 ^d$\n\nand having sufficiently small Hausdorff co-dimension. The main new 
 ingredient is an effective\nequidistribution theorem for certain fractal m
 easures on the space of unimodular lattices. The latter\nis established vi
 a a new technique involving the construction of $S$-arithmetic Markov oper
 ators\npossessing a spectral gap and encoding the arithmetic structure of 
 the maps generating the fractal.\nThis is joint work in progress with Manu
 el Luethi.\n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/math-seminars

DESCRIPTION:Host: University of Maryland \nSpeaker: Anthony Quas (Victoria
 ) \nURL: https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference.html \n\n---\nIt is 
 known\, by work of Bochi\, Mañé\, Viana and others\nthat Lyapunov expone
 nts are highly sensitive to perturbations of a\ndynamical system. On the o
 ther hand\, work of Ledrappier\, Young\nand my work with Froyland and Gonz
 ´alez-Tokman has shown that\nin some situations\, under “noise-like” 
 perturbations\, Lyapunov exponents vary continuously.\nWe are particularly
  interested in cocycles of Perron-Frobenius\noperators\, as the Lyapunov e
 xponents (and the corresponding Oseledets spaces) are related to rates of 
 mixing (and the spaces can\nidentify obstructions to mixing). We discuss a
  test case of a random composition of Blaschke products\, and their Perron
 -Frobenius\noperators acting on a Hardy space of analytic functions. These
  operators are known to be compact. We identify the full Lyapunov\nspectru
 m of these systems\, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the 
 stability of the spectrum. [Joint work with Cecilia\nGonz´alez-Tokman.]\n

DESCRIPTION:Host: MAD+ \nSpeaker: Philippe Rigollet (MIT) \nURL: http://ma
 d.cds.nyu.edu/madplus/ \n\n---\nThe notion of average is central to most s
 tatistical methods. In this talk we study a generalization of this notion 
 over the non-​Euclidean space of probability measures equipped with a ce
 rtain Wasserstein distance. This generalization is often called Wasserstei
 n Barycenters and empirical evidence suggests that these barycenters allow
  to capture interesting notions of averages in graphics\, data assimilatio
 n and morphometrics. However the statistical (rates of convergence) and co
 mputational (efficient algorithms) for these Wasserstein barycenters are l
 argely unexplored. The goal of this talk is to review two recent results:

 nThis talk is a fragment from a larger work on approximating Markov proces
 ses. I will focus on a functorial definition of conditional expectation wi
 thout talking about how it was used. We define categories of cones---which
  are abstract versions of the familiar cones in vector spaces---of measure
 s and related categories cones of Lₚ functions. We will state a number o
 f dualities and isomorphisms between these categories. Then we will define
  conditional expectation by exploiting these dualities: it will turn out t
 hat we can define conditional expectation with respect to certain morphism
 s. These generalize the standard notion of conditioning with respect to a 
 sub-sigma algebra. Why did I use the plural? Because it turns out that the
 re are two kinds of conditional expectation\, one of which looks like a le
 ft adjoint (in the matrix sense not the categorical sense) and the other l
 ooks like a right adjoint. I will review concepts like image measure\, Rad
 on-Nikodym derivatives and the traditional definition of conditional expec
 tation. This is joint work with Philippe Chaput\, Vincent Danos and Gordon
  Plotkin. \n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/math-seminars

 kar) We discuss a new method to bound 5-torsion in class groups of quadrat
 ic fields using the refined BSD conjecture for elliptic curves. The most n
 atural “trivial” bound on the n-torsion is to bound it by the size of 
 the entire class group\, for which one has a global class number formula. 
 We explain how to make sense of the n-torsion of a class group intrinsical
 ly as a selmer group of a Galois module. We may then similarly bound its s
 ize by the Tate-Shafarevich group of an appropriate elliptic curve\, which
  we can bound using the BSD conjecture. This fits into a general paradigm 
 where one bounds selmer groups of finite Galois modules by embedding into 
 global objects\, and using class number formulas. If time permits\, we exp
 lain how the function field picture yields unconditional results and sugge
 sts further generalizations.\n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/m

 Identifiability is a crucial property for a statistical model since it imp
 lies that distributions in the model uniquely determine the parameters tha
 t produce them. In phylogenetics\, the identifiability of the tree paramet
 er is of particular interest since it means that phylogenetic models can b
 e used to infer evolutionary histories from data. Typical strategies for p
 roving identifiability results require Gröbner basis computations which b
 ecome untenable as the size of the model grows. In this talk I'll give som
 e background on phylogenetic algebraic geometry and then discuss a new com
 putational strategy for proving the identifiability of discrete parameters
  in algebraic statistical models that uses algebraic matroids naturally as
 sociated to the models. This algorithm allows us to avoid computing Gröbn
 er bases and is also parallelizable.\n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedi

 y to study networks with inputs and outputs. Here we illustrate this using
  a type of network popular in theoretical computer science: Petri nets. An
  "open" Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outp
 uts. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the in
 puts of another. Using the formalism of structured cospans\, open Petri ne
 ts can be treated as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category - or bette
 r\, a symmetric monoidal double category. We explain two forms of semantic
 s for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of this
  double category. The first\, an operational semantics\, gives for each op
 en Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net ca
 n carry out. The second\, a "reachability" semantics\, simply says which m
 arkings of the outputs can be reached from a given marking of the inputs.

  type theory where types represent ∞-categories\, generalizing groupoids
 . A bisimplicial approach to directed type theory\, developed by Riehl and
  Shulman\, is based on equipping each type with both a notion of path and 
 a separate notion of directed morphism. In this setting\, a directed analo
 gue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant 
 discrete fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions—a h
 igher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In this 
 talk\, I’ll present a constructive model of a directed type theory with 
 directed univalence in bicubical\, rather than bisimplicial\, sets. We for
 malize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos
 \, following Orton and Pitts. First\, building on the cubical techniques u
 sed to give computational models of homotopy type theory\, we show that th
 ere is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations\, with a partial direct
 ed univalence principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphism
 s in this universe. To complete this retraction into an equivalence\, we r
 efine the universe of covariant fibrations using the constructive sheaf mo
 dels by Coquand and Ruch. (Joint work with Dan Licata)\n\n---\nEvent gener

  in space\, for every initial datum $x$ there is a unique trajectory $\\ga

 URL: http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~drm/WHCGP/ \n\n---\nIt has long been known 
 that holomorphic field theories on twistor space lead to "physical" field 
 theories on Minkowski space. In this talk I will discuss a type I (unorien
 ted) version of the topological B model on twistor space. The correspondin
 g theory on Minkowski space is a sigma-model with target the group SO(8). 
 This is a variant of the Skyrme model that appears as the low-energy effec
 tive theory of mesons in QCD. (The group SO(8) appears because of the Gree
 n-Schwarz mechanism in the topological string). The origin of this model i
 n the topological string implies many remarkable properties. For one thing
 \, the model is\, in a certain sense\, integrable. Further\, although the 
 Lagrangian is power-counting non-renormalizable\, counter-terms at all loo
 ps can be uniquely fixed.\n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/math

 / \n\n---\nPetri nets have been of interest to applied category theory for
  some time. Back in the 1980s\, one approach to their semantics was given 
 by algebraic gadgets called “event structures.” We use classical techn
 iques from order theory to study event structures without conflict restric
 tions (which we term “dependency structures with choice”) by their ass
 ociated “traces”\, which let us establish a one-to-one correspondence 
 between DSCs and a certain class of locales. These locales have an interna
 l logic of reachability\, which can be equipped with “versioning” moda
 lities that let us abstract away certain unnecessary detail from an underl
 ying DSC. With this in hand we can give a general notion of what it means 
 to “solve a dependency problem” and combinatorial results bounding the
  complexity of this. Time permitting\, I will sketch work-in-progress whic
 h hopes to equip these locales with a notion of conflict\, letting us capt
 ure the full semantics of general event structures in the form of homologi
 cal data\, thus providing one avenue to the topological semantics of concu
 rrent systems. This is joint work with Raymond Puzio. \n\n---\nEvent gener

 \n\n---\nMany combinatorial optimization problems defined on random instan
 ces\, such as random graphs\, exhibit an apparent gap between the optimal 
 values\, which can be computed by non-constructive means\, and the best va
 lues achievable by fast (polynomial time) algorithms. Through a combined e
 ffort of mathematicians\, computer scientists and statistical physicists\,
  it became apparent that a potential\, and in some cases\, a provable barr
 ier for designing fast algorithms bridging this gap is an intricate topolo
 gy of nearly optimal solutions\, in particular the presence of a certain O
 verlap Gap Property (OGP)\, which we will introduce in this talk. We will 
 demonstrate how for many such problems the onset of the OGP phase transiti
 on indeed nearly coincides with algorithmically hard regimes and provides 
 a provable barrier to a broad class of polynomial time algorithms. Our exa
 mples will include the problem of finding a largest independent set of a r
 andom graph\, finding a largest cut in a random hypergraph\, the problem o
 f finding a ground state of a p-spin model\, and also many models in high-
 dimensional statistics and machine learning fields. The classes of algorit
 hms ruled out by the OGP include local algorithms\, Markov Chain Monte Car
 lo\, Approximate Message Passing and low-degree polynomial based algorithm

 \n\n---\nProgram termination is a key question in program verification. Th
 is talk considers the termination of probabilistic programs\, programs tha
 t can describe randomised algorithms and more recently received attention 
 in machine learning. Probabilistic termination has several nuances and has
  some unexpected effects. Programs may diverge with zero probability\; the
 y almost-surely terminate (AST). Two AST-programs run in sequence may have
  an infinite expected run-time\, though each of its constituents has a fin
 ite expected run-time.\n\nThis talk will demystify the notions of probabil
 istic termination\, its surprising effects\, and its hardness ("degree of 
 undecidability"). We will show a simple proof rule for deciding AST.\n\nTh
 e Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics is a new series of fortn
 ightly research talks\, highlighting the most exciting recent work in the 
 international computer science logic community. The scope of the seminar s
 eries is roughly that of the major computer science logic conferences such
  as LICS\, ICALP and FSCD.\n\nIn this time of restricted international tra
 vel\, a key aim of this series is to provide a forum for the informal disc
 ussion and social interaction that is so important for the progress of sci
 ence. To facilitate this\, the seminar incorporates in virtual form a numb
 er of features more normally associated with physical meetings:\n\nVirtual
  "coffee breaks" before and after the seminar\, allowing participants to c
 hat in small groups\, replicating the social element of a real-world confe
 rence. Robust technology platform supporting hundreds of interactive parti
 cipants. Live-stream of the speaker's slides visible alongside the speaker
 's face\, allowing nuanced communication at a human level. Chairperson to 
 introduce the speaker\, facilitate questions from the audience\, and keep 
 proceedings running on time. Aggregate nonverbal feedback from audience me
 mbers\, such as "go faster" or "slow down"\, reported in real-time to the 
 speaker. Audience members whose question is selected by the chairperson ca
 n deliver it in full audio and video\, giving a natural interaction with t
 he speaker. No need to register\, just show up.\n\n---\nEvent generated by

 st/pde-seminar-via-zoom \n\n---\nThe wave turbulence theory describes the 
 nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for a large class of nonlinear disper
 sive systems. A major goal of this theory is to derive the wave kinetic eq
 uation\, which predicts the behavior of macroscopic limits of ensemble ave
 rages for microscopic interacting systems. Usually this limit happens at a
  particular "kinetic time scale" in the "weak-nonlinearity" limit where th
 e number of interacting modes goes to infinity while the nonlinearity stre
 ngth goes to zero. For nonlinear Schrodinger equations such limits have be
 en derived on a formal level and studied extensively since the 1920s\, but
  a rigorous proof remains open.\n\nIn this work\, joint with Zaher Hani\, 
 we provide the first rigorous derivation of wave kinetic equation\, which 
 reaches the kinetic time scale up to an arbitrary small power\, in a parti
 cular scaling regime for the number of modes and the strength of nonlinear
 ity. We rely on a robust method\, which can be extended to other semilinea
 r models\, and possibly also to quasilinear models (such as water waves).\

 \, not just in topology\, but in algebraic geometry\, complex analysis\, d
 ynamics\, and even number theory. The topology of a family of surfaces is 
 governed by a “monodromy representation” that is valued in the mapping
  class group. I’m interested in (a) developing tools within the mapping 
 class group to better understand monodromy and (b) applying these tools to
  problems involving families of surfaces\, inside and out of topology prop
 er. The thrust of my work over the past few years has been to understand t
 he monodromy of families of surfaces endowed with certain tangential struc
 tures (e.g. a framing\, a holomorphic 1-form with prescribed zeroes\, an 
 “r-spin structure”\, etc.) and to apply this to study the topology of 
 the spaces supporting such families (strata of abelian differentials\, lin
 ear systems in certain algebraic surfaces\, versal deformation spaces of p
 lane curve singularities). This represents joint work with Aaron Calderon 
 and Pablo Portilla Cuadrado. \n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/

DESCRIPTION:Host: MIT \nSpeaker: Michele Coti Zelati (Imperial College Lon
 don) \nURL: https://math.mit.edu/seminars/pde-analysis/ \n\n---\nWe review
  some recent results on the asymptotic stability of stationary solutions t
 o the two-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible 
 flows. In many cases\, sharp decay rates for the linearized problem imply 
 some sort of nonlinear asymptotic stability\, both in the Euler equations 
 (through the so-called inviscid damping) and the Navier-Stokes equations (
 undergoing enhanced dissipation). However\, we will see that in the case o
 f the 2D square periodic domain\, the so-called Kolmogorov flow exhibits m
 uch more complex behavior: in particular\, linear asymptotic stability hol
 ds\, while nonlinear asymptotic stability is not true even for analytic pe
 rturbations.\n\n---\nEvent generated by jaume.dedios.cat/math-seminars
