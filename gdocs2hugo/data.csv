-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,A p-adic monodromy theorem for de Rham local systems,Koji Shimizu,IAS,"Every smooth proper algebraic variety over a p-adic field is expected to have semistable model after passing to a finite extension. This conjecture is open in general, but its analogue for p-adic Galois representations, the p-adic monodromy theorem, is known. In this talk, we will explain a generalization of this theorem to etale local systems on a smooth rigid analytic variety.",UCLA,https://secure.math.ucla.edu/seminars/display.php?&id=833983,No,"Math.AG, Math.

-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,Attacking Classical Problems in Dynamical Systems with Descriptive Set Theory,Matthew Foreman,UC Irvine,"In his classical 1932 paper, von Neumann asked 3 questions: Can you classify the statistical behavior of differentiable systems? Are there systems where time-forward is not isomorphic to time-backward? Is every abstract statistical system isomorphic to a differentiable system? These questions can be addressed with some surprising consequences by embedding them in Polish Spaces. Indeed the tools answer other questions from the 60's and 70's such as the existence of diffeomorphisms with arbitrary Choquet simplexes of invariant measures. Moreover there are surprising analogues to Hilbert's 10th problem.

In a different category, building on work of Poincare, Smale proposed classifying the qualitative behavior of differentiable systems on compact manifolds. His 1967 paper explicitly argued that the equivalence relation of ""conjugacy up to homeomorphism"" captures this notion and he proposes classifying it. Call this notion topological equivalence. Very recent joint results with A. Gorodetski show:

- The equivalence relation $E _ 0$ is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth 2-manifold.

- The equivalent relation of Graph Isomorphism is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth manifold of dimension 5 or above.

As corollaries, none of the classical numerical invariants such as entropy, rates of growth of periodic points and so forth, can classify diffeomorphisms of 2-manifolds, and there is no Borel classification at all of diffeomorphisms of 5-manifolds.

In the same 1967 paper Smale asks (in different language) whether there is a generic class that can be classified. This is still an open problem.

-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,On the Kudla-Rapoport conjecture,Chao Li,Columbia University,"The Kudla-Rapoport conjecture predicts a precise identity between the arithmetic intersection number of special cycles on unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces and the derivative of local representation densities of hermitian forms. It is a key local ingredient to establish the arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula and the arithmetic Rallis inner product formula, relating the height of special cycles on Shimura varieties to the derivative of Siegel Eisenstein series and L-functions. We will motivate this conjecture, explain a proof and discuss global applications.

-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,Pure Pairs,Paul Seymour,Princeton,"A ""pure pair"" in a graph $G$ is a pair $(X,Y)$ of disjoint subsets of $V(G)$ such that either every vertex in $X$ is adjacent to every vertex in $Y$, or there are no edges from $X$ to $Y$. Let $f(G)$ be the biggest $k$ such that $G$ has a pure pair $(X,Y)$ with $|X|,|Y|$ at least $k$. In general, $f(G)$ is logarithmic in $|G|$, and for any fixed graph $H$, if $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph then $f(G)$ is polynomial in $|G|$. (This is a result of Erdos, Hajnal and Pach.) But when is $f(G)$ linear in $|G|$?

A couple of years ago, we proved a nice thing, a conjecture of Liebenau and Pilipczuk: for any finite set $C$ of graphs, $f(G)$ is linear in $G|$ for all graphs with no induced subgraph in $C$, if and only $C$ contains a forest and the complement of a forest. This result has grown a number of extensions and variations since. (What about bipartite graphs? What about ordered graphs? What about nearly-linear? What if the two sets have different sizes?).

Compared to traditional machine learning problems, inverse problems are often limited by the size of the training data set. We show how to overcome this issue by incorporating mathematical analysis and physics into the design of neural network architectures. We first describe neural network representations of pseudodifferential operators and Fourier integral operators. We then continue to discuss applications including electric impedance tomography, optical tomography, inverse acoustic/EM scattering, and travel-time tomography.",UC Berkeley,https://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/math.html?event_ID=132641&date=2020-04-08&filter=Secondary%20Event%20Type&filtersel=,No,,08/04/2020,16:10:00,17:00:00,UTC -07:00,YES
-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,Circumcenter extension maps for Hadamard manifolds,Merlin Incerti-Medici,University of Zurich,"Given a CAT(-1) space, we can associate to it a boundary at infinity and a cross ratio on said boundary. There is a series of results that tell us that, for sufficiently nice CAT(-1) spaces, the boundary together with the cross ratio uniquely determines the interior space. The proof of these results can be understood in terms of the construction of a circumcenter extension map. It turns out that this relationship between boundary and interior space generalizes nicely to a large class of CAT(0) spaces. In this talk, we will survey some known results, explain the construction of the circumcenter extension and show that the boundary roughly determines the interior space for a large class of manifolds.",Ohio State University,https://sites.google.com/view/topoandggt,No,"Math.MG, Math.DG",16/04/2020,14:00:00,15:00:00,UTC -04:00,YES

The notorious Collatz conjecture asserts that all orbits of this map eventually attain the value 1. This remains open, even if one is willing to work with almost all orbits rather than all orbits. We show that almost all orbits n, Col(n), Col^2(n), ... eventually attain a value less than f(n), for any function f that goes to infinity (no matter how slowly). A key step is to obtain an approximately invariant (or more precisely, self-similar) measure for the (accelerated) Collatz dynamics.",Caltech,https://secure.math.ucla.edu/seminars/display.php?&id=834022,No,Math.NT,7/04/2020,17:00:00,17:50:00,"UTC -07:00 (Los Angeles, PDT)",YES
