-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,A p-adic monodromy theorem for de Rham local systems,Koji Shimizu,IAS,"Every smooth proper algebraic variety over a p-adic field is expected to have semistable model after passing to a finite extension.

-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,Attacking Classical Problems in Dynamical Systems with Descriptive Set Theory,Matthew Foreman,UC Irvine,"In his classical 1932 paper, von Neumann asked 3 questions: Can you classify the statistical behavior of differentiable systems? Are there systems where time-forward is not isomorphic to time-backward? Is every abstract statistical system isomorphic to a differentiable system? These questions can be addressed with some surprising consequences by embedding them in Polish Spaces. Indeed the tools answer other questions from the 60's and 70's such as the existence of diffeomorphisms with arbitrary Choquet simplexes of invariant measures. Moreover there are surprising analogues to Hilbert's 10th problem.

In a different category, building on work of Poincare, Smale proposed classifying the qualitative behavior of differentiable systems on compact manifolds. His 1967 paper explicitly argued that the equivalence relation of ""conjugacy up to homeomorphism"" captures this notion and he proposes classifying it. Call this notion topological equivalence. Very recent joint results with A. Gorodetski show:

- The equivalence relation $E _ 0$ is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth 2-manifold.

- The equivalent relation of Graph Isomorphism is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth manifold of dimension 5 or above.

As corollaries, none of the classical numerical invariants such as entropy, rates of growth of periodic points and so forth, can classify diffeomorphisms of 2-manifolds, and there is no Borel classification at all of diffeomorphisms of 5-manifolds.

In the same 1967 paper Smale asks (in different language) whether there is a generic class that can be classified. This is still an open problem.

-1,jaumededios@gmail.com,Pure Pairs,Paul Seymour,Princeton,"A ""pure pair"" in a graph $G$ is a pair $(X,Y)$ of disjoint subsets of $V(G)$ such that either every vertex in $X$ is adjacent to every vertex in $Y$, or there are no edges from $X$ to $Y$. Let $f(G)$ be the biggest $k$ such that $G$ has a pure pair $(X,Y)$ with $|X|,|Y|$ at least $k$. In general, $f(G)$ is logarithmic in $|G|$, and for any fixed graph $H$, if $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph then $f(G)$ is polynomial in $|G|$. (This is a result of Erdos, Hajnal and Pach.) But when is $f(G)$ linear in $|G|$?

A couple of years ago, we proved a nice thing, a conjecture of Liebenau and Pilipczuk: for any finite set $C$ of graphs, $f(G)$ is linear in $G|$ for all graphs with no induced subgraph in $C$, if and only $C$ contains a forest and the complement of a forest. This result has grown a number of extensions and variations since. (What about bipartite graphs? What about ordered graphs? What about nearly-linear? What if the two sets have different sizes?).

There is a series of results that tell us that, for sufficiently nice CAT(-1) spaces, the boundary together with the cross ratio uniquely determines the interior space. The proof of these results can be understood in terms of the construction of a circumcenter extension map. It turns out that this relationship between boundary and interior space generalizes nicely to a large class of CAT(0) spaces. In this talk, we will survey some known results, explain the construction of the circumcenter extension and show that the boundary roughly determines the interior space for a large class of manifolds.",Ohio State University,https://sites.google.com/view/topoandggt,No,"Math.MG, Math.DG",16/04/2020,14:00:00,15:00:00,UTC -04:00,YES

We show that almost all orbits n, Col(n), Col^2(n), ... eventually attain a value less than f(n), for any function f that goes to infinity (no matter how slowly).

In this talk we study a generalization of this notion over the non-​Euclidean space of probability measures equipped with a certain Wasserstein distance. This generalization is often called Wasserstein Barycenters and empirical evidence suggests that these barycenters allow to capture interesting notions of averages in graphics, data assimilation and morphometrics. However the statistical (rates of convergence) and computational (efficient algorithms) for these Wasserstein barycenters are largely unexplored. The goal of this talk is to review two recent results: 1. Fast rates of convergence for empirical barycenters in general geodesic spaces, and, 2. Provable guarantees for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent to compute Wasserstein barycenters. Both results leverage geometric aspects of optimal transport.

I will focus on a functorial definition of conditional expectation without talking about how it was used. We define categories of cones---which are abstract versions of the familiar cones in vector spaces---of measures and related categories cones of Lₚ functions. We will state a number of dualities and isomorphisms between these categories. Then we will define conditional expectation by exploiting these dualities: it will turn out that we can define conditional expectation with respect to certain morphisms. These generalize the standard notion of conditioning with respect to a sub-sigma algebra. Why did I use the plural? Because it turns out that there are two kinds of conditional expectation, one of which looks like a left adjoint (in the matrix sense not the categorical sense) and the other looks like a right adjoint. I will review concepts like image measure, Radon-Nikodym derivatives and the traditional definition of conditional expectation.

The most natural “trivial” bound on the n-torsion is to bound it by the size of the entire class group, for which one has a global class number formula. We explain how to make sense of the n-torsion of a class group intrinsically as a selmer group of a Galois module. We may then similarly bound its size by the Tate-Shafarevich group of an appropriate elliptic curve, which we can bound using the BSD conjecture. This fits into a general paradigm where one bounds selmer groups of finite Galois modules by embedding into global objects, and using class number formulas.

The firing patterns of a collection of n place cells can be represented by a neural code C on n neurons, which is a subset of the power set of {1,2,...,n}. Determining whether C is convex, meaning that there is an arrangement of convex open place fields for which C is the code, remains an open problem.

A sufficient condition for convexity is being max intersection complete: any intersection of maximal elements of C is also an element of C. Currently, the only way to determine this property is to evaluate all such intersections. We present a new method to determine max intersection completeness by introducing a simplicial complex for C called the factor complex of C. We show how to construct the factor complex using Stanley-Reisner theory, describe how this complex encodes information about C, and give an algorithm to check whether C is max intersection complete using the factor complex of a closely related code.",Universtity of Washington,https://math.washington.edu/events/2020-04-08/neural-codes-and-factor-complex,No,math.CO,8/04/2020,15:30:00,17:00:00,"UTC -07:00 (Los Angeles, PDT)",YES
