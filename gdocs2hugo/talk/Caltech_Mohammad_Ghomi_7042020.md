The classical isoperimetric inequality states that in Euclidean space spheres provide enclosures of least perimeter for any given volume. According to the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture, this inequality may be generalized to spaces of nonpositive curvature. In this talk we discuss an approach to proving this conjecture via a comparison formula for the total curvature of level sets of functions on nonpositively curved manifolds. This is joint work with Joel Spruck.
