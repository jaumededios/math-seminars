Huang, McKinnon, and Satriano conjectured that if a real vector $(v_1,...,v_n)$ has distinct coordinates and $n\ge3$, then a hyperplane through the origin other than $x_1+...+x_n=0$ contains at most $2(nâˆ’2)!\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ of the vectors obtained by permuting the coordinates of $v$. I will discuss a proof of this conjecture.
