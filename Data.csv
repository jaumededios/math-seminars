-1,A p-adic monodromy theorem for de Rham local systems,Koji Shimizu,IAS,"Every smooth proper algebraic variety over a p-adic field is expected to have semistable model after passing to a finite extension.

-1,Attacking Classical Problems in Dynamical Systems with Descriptive Set Theory,Matthew Foreman,UC Irvine,"In his classical 1932 paper, von Neumann asked 3 questions: Can you classify the statistical behavior of differentiable systems? Are there systems where time-forward is not isomorphic to time-backward? Is every abstract statistical system isomorphic to a differentiable system? These questions can be addressed with some surprising consequences by embedding them in Polish Spaces. Indeed the tools answer other questions from the 60's and 70's such as the existence of diffeomorphisms with arbitrary Choquet simplexes of invariant measures. Moreover there are surprising analogues to Hilbert's 10th problem.

In a different category, building on work of Poincare, Smale proposed classifying the qualitative behavior of differentiable systems on compact manifolds. His 1967 paper explicitly argued that the equivalence relation of ""conjugacy up to homeomorphism"" captures this notion and he proposes classifying it. Call this notion topological equivalence. Very recent joint results with A. Gorodetski show:

- The equivalence relation $E _ 0$ is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth 2-manifold.

- The equivalent relation of Graph Isomorphism is Borel reducible to topological equivalence of diffeomorphisms of any smooth manifold of dimension 5 or above.

As corollaries, none of the classical numerical invariants such as entropy, rates of growth of periodic points and so forth, can classify diffeomorphisms of 2-manifolds, and there is no Borel classification at all of diffeomorphisms of 5-manifolds.

In the same 1967 paper Smale asks (in different language) whether there is a generic class that can be classified. This is still an open problem.

-1,Pure Pairs,Paul Seymour,Princeton,"A ""pure pair"" in a graph $G$ is a pair $(X,Y)$ of disjoint subsets of $V(G)$ such that either every vertex in $X$ is adjacent to every vertex in $Y$, or there are no edges from $X$ to $Y$. Let $f(G)$ be the biggest $k$ such that $G$ has a pure pair $(X,Y)$ with $|X|,|Y|$ at least $k$. In general, $f(G)$ is logarithmic in $|G|$, and for any fixed graph $H$, if $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph then $f(G)$ is polynomial in $|G|$. (This is a result of Erdos, Hajnal and Pach.) But when is $f(G)$ linear in $|G|$?

A couple of years ago, we proved a nice thing, a conjecture of Liebenau and Pilipczuk: for any finite set $C$ of graphs, $f(G)$ is linear in $G|$ for all graphs with no induced subgraph in $C$, if and only $C$ contains a forest and the complement of a forest. This result has grown a number of extensions and variations since. (What about bipartite graphs? What about ordered graphs? What about nearly-linear? What if the two sets have different sizes?).

-1,"Random walks, spectral gaps, and Khinchine's theorem on fractals",Osama Khalil,Utah,"In 1984, Mahler asked how well typical points on Cantor’s set can be approximated by
rational numbers. His question fits within a program, set out by himself in the 1930s, attempting to
determine conditions under which subsets of $\mathbb R^d$
inherit the Diophantine properties of the ambient
space. Since the approximability of typical points in Euclidean space by rational points is governed
by Khinchine’s classical theorem, the ultimate form of Mahler’s question asks whether an analogous
zero-one law holds for fractal measures. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years,
albeit, almost all known results have been of “convergence type”.
In this talk, we will discuss the first instances where a complete analogue of Khinchine’s theorem
for fractal measures is obtained. Our results hold for fractals generated by rational similarities of $\mathbb R^d$

and having sufficiently small Hausdorff co-dimension. The main new ingredient is an effective
equidistribution theorem for certain fractal measures on the space of unimodular lattices. The latter
is established via a new technique involving the construction of $S$-arithmetic Markov operators
possessing a spectral gap and encoding the arithmetic structure of the maps generating the fractal.

in some situations, under “noise-like” perturbations, Lyapunov exponents vary continuously.
We are particularly interested in cocycles of Perron-Frobenius
operators, as the Lyapunov exponents (and the corresponding Oseledets spaces) are related to rates of mixing (and the spaces can
identify obstructions to mixing). We discuss a test case of a random composition of Blaschke products, and their Perron-Frobenius
operators acting on a Hardy space of analytic functions. These operators are known to be compact. We identify the full Lyapunov
spectrum of these systems, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the spectrum. [Joint work with Cecilia

We define categories of cones---which are abstract versions of the familiar cones in vector spaces---of measures and related categories cones of Lₚ functions.

Then we will define conditional expectation by exploiting these dualities: it will turn out that we can define conditional expectation with respect to certain morphisms. These generalize the standard notion of conditioning with respect to a sub-sigma algebra. Why did I use the plural? Because it turns out that there are two kinds of conditional expectation, one of which looks like a left adjoint (in the matrix sense not the categorical sense) and the other looks like a right adjoint.

The most natural “trivial” bound on the n-torsion is to bound it by the size of the entire class group, for which one has a global class number formula. We explain how to make sense of the n-torsion of a class group intrinsically as a selmer group of a Galois module. We may then similarly bound its size by the Tate-Shafarevich group of an appropriate elliptic curve, which we can bound using the BSD conjecture. This fits into a general paradigm where one bounds selmer groups of finite Galois modules by embedding into global objects, and using class number formulas.

The firing patterns of a collection of n place cells can be represented by a neural code C on n neurons, which is a subset of the power set of {1,2,...,n}. Determining whether C is convex, meaning that there is an arrangement of convex open place fields for which C is the code, remains an open problem.

A sufficient condition for convexity is being max intersection complete: any intersection of maximal elements of C is also an element of C. Currently, the only way to determine this property is to evaluate all such intersections. We present a new method to determine max intersection completeness by introducing a simplicial complex for C called the factor complex of C. We show how to construct the factor complex using Stanley-Reisner theory, describe how this complex encodes information about C, and give an algorithm to check whether C is max intersection complete using the factor complex of a closely related code.",Universtity of Washington,https://math.washington.edu/events/2020-04-08/neural-codes-and-factor-complex,No,math.CO,8/04/2020,15:30:00,17:00:00,"UTC -07:00 (Los Angeles, PDT)",YES

In phylogenetics, the identifiability of the tree parameter is of particular interest since it means that phylogenetic models can be used to infer evolutionary histories from data. Typical strategies for proving identifiability results require Gröbner basis computations which become untenable as the size of the model grows. In this talk I'll give some background on phylogenetic algebraic geometry and then discuss a new computational strategy for proving the identifiability of discrete parameters in algebraic statistical models that uses algebraic matroids naturally associated to the models.

The n-th punctual Hilbert scheme $Hilb_0^n(A^d)$ of points of affine d-space parametrises ideals of finite co-length n of the ring of functions on d-dimensional affine space, whose radical is the maximal ideal at the origin (equivalently, subschemes of length n with support at the origin). A classical theorem of Briancon claims the irreducibility of this space for d=2 and arbitrary n. The case of a small number of points being straightforward, the first nontrivial case is the case of 4 points in 3-space. We show, answering a question of Sturmfels, that over the complex numbers $Hilb_0^4(A^3)$ is irreducible.

8/04/2020 13:47:48,Structured cospans, John Baez,UC Riverside,"""Structured cospans"" are a general way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Here we illustrate this using a type of network popular in theoretical computer science: Petri nets. An ""open"" Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Using the formalism of structured cospans, open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category - or better, a symmetric monoidal double category. We explain two forms of semantics for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of this double category. The first, an operational semantics, gives for each open Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net can carry out. The second, a ""reachability"" semantics, simply says which markings of the outputs can be reached from a given marking of the inputs.

8/04/2020 14:25:20,A constructive model of directed univalence in bicubical sets,Matthew Weaver,Princeton University,"Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types represent ∞-categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on equipping each type with both a notion of path and a separate notion of directed morphism. In this setting, a directed analogue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions—a higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In this talk, I’ll present a constructive model of a directed type theory with directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos, following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical techniques used to give computational models of homotopy type theory, we show that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations, with a partial directed univalence principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphisms in this universe. To complete this retraction into an equivalence, we refine the universe of covariant fibrations using the constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch.

The classical Cauchy-Lipschitz (also named Picard-Lindel\""of) Theorem states that, if the vector field $v$ is Lipschitz in space, for every initial datum $x$ there is a unique trajectory $\gamma$ starting at $x$ at time $0$ and solving the ODE $\dot{\gamma} (t) = v (t, \gamma (t))$. The theorem looses its validity as soon as $v$ is slightly less regular. However, if we bundle all trajectories into a global map allowing $x$ to vary, a celebrated theory put forward by DiPerna and Lions in the 80es show that there is a unique such flow under very reasonable conditions and for much less regular vector fields. A long-standing open question is whether this theory is the byproduct of a stronger classical result which ensures the uniqueness of trajectories for {\em almost every} initial datum.

We investigate a natural coarse analogue of this index which can be used, e.g., to show that a separable metric space that contains coarse copies of all members in certain “small"" classes of metric spaces C then X contains a coarse copy of $c_0$ and thus of all separable metric spaces.

These locales have an internal logic of reachability, which can be equipped with “versioning” modalities that let us abstract away certain unnecessary detail from an underlying DSC. With this in hand we can give a general notion of what it means to “solve a dependency problem” and combinatorial results bounding the complexity of this. Time permitting, I will sketch work-in-progress which hopes to equip these locales with a notion of conflict, letting us capture the full semantics of general event structures in the form of homological data, thus providing one avenue to the topological semantics of concurrent systems.
